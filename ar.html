      <p>
        Is there any technology that has more persistently disappointed, while
        still maintaining public desire, than virtual reality? Our dogged
        pursuit of effective and immersive virtual and augmented reality,
        despite their many failures, is evidence of our endurance and
        willingness to overlook flaws when it comes to making cool stuff.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
         Even though so many attempts
        have been disappointing — and some of them have been very disappointing
        — we can't seem to let go of the dream of seamlessly stepping into a
        virtual world like the oasis from "Ready Player One," or the metaverse
        from "Snow Crash."
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        On second thought, maybe it's best we haven't succeeded in building
        those worlds. In any event, virtual and augmented reality appear to have
        finally gained some foothold despite not being precisely what we
        imagined. If we stick it out, there's some evidence it will eventually
        pay off. As explained by <a href="#"> Strategy + Business</a>, technologies like virtual
        and augmented reality typically only succeed after a long lead-up. Any
        overnight tech success was likely a decade or more in the making, and VR
        is no different. The near wins, and even the obvious losses, could
        provide the foundation on which truly immersive digital realities are
        built. We just have to endure the flops.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h1>Vitual Boy</h1>
      <br />
      <img class="addimg" src="images/virtual-boy-1663425663.webp" alt="" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In the '90s, Nintendo was riding a wave of successive hits after the
        release of the NES, the Super NES, and the Game Boy. That success was
        certainly well earned, but might have given the company a little too
        much confidence. It was primed for a misstep.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        At the same time, the popularity of virtual reality was cresting, and
        the two forces came together into a product that has a certain cult
        appreciation, but was nonetheless a failure: Nintendo's Virtual Boy.
        According to <a href="#"> Fast Company</a>, the Virtual Boy might have been much cooler
        than what we eventually got, if not for a series of adjustments during
        development and launch. Nintendo was treading into largely unmapped
        territory, and it didn't want to get sued. The Virtual Boy was basically
        a collection of compromises and half measures, molded into a box you
        could stick your face inside.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Consequently, the Virtual Boy sold only about 770,000 units in its
        lifetime (via <a href="#"> Nintendo Life</a>). That's compared to the <a href="#"> tens of millions of
        units</a> Nintendo was used to selling with its other consoles.
        Technological limitations also played into a failed launch. Graphics
        comprised entirely of red images on a black field just couldn't compete
        in a market obsessed with full color. While the Virtual Boy was
        objectively a complete game <a href="#"> console flop</a>, it was at least good enough
        that it's looked back on with fondness. It even got a <a href="#">  Google Cardboard
        reprisal</a> in 2016.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h1>VR Movies</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img class="addimg" src="images/vr-movies-1663425663.webp" alt="" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        At the start of VR's modern peak, when people started to believe in the
        technology again, there was talk of VR shifting away from games and
        toward movies. It makes a certain amount of intuitive sense; they're
        both visual mediums, after all. And who wouldn't want to experience
        <a href="#"> their favorite flicks in a more immersive way?</a>
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        As explained by <a href="#"> Scientific American</a>, there have been some attempts to
        make VR movies work, but they have largely failed. Importantly, they
        didn't fail at being virtual reality, but they did fail at being movies.
        We probably should have seen it coming. Every time a movie or game is
        adapted to film, we have to reckon with the fact that different mediums
        cooperate with one another only against their will.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        As it turns out, movies have particular conventions that don't
        necessarily lend themselves to VR. As Scientific American goes on to
        explain, movies work because a filmmaker can control our attention. They
        lay out story beats confident that viewers aren't going to miss them
        because they are literally on display. The ability to look around in 360
        degrees at any given time threatens that sort of storytelling.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Some creators have taken a hybrid approach, displaying movies in VR as
        if they are playing on a massive movie theater screen. While it can be
        fun once or twice, the novelty wears off pretty soon, and it's not
        exactly the medium-shattering shift some promised.
      </p>

      <h1>Magic Leap</h1>

      <p>
        While virtual reality has more potential in the entertainment space,
        augmented reality might be the way most people in the future interface
        with virtual objects. The applications are broad, and the potential
        customer base is nearly limitless. Even people who aren't particularly
        interested in technology can see the benefits of having emails and other
        notifications delivered straight to your face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Anyone who has played the <a href="#"> AR mode in Pokémon Go</a> has at least a passing
        familiarity with how it works. A wearable computer generates digital
        assets which are overlaid on top of the real world. You can interact
        with the virtual world, without being caged inside of it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2019, <a href="#"> Magic Leap</a> was the bell of the ball when it came to AR
        startups. It made big promises about seamlessly blending virtual reality
        with actual reality. Their pitch must have been strong because they
        collected billions in funding from companies like Google and Disney (via
        Input). The company released impressive-looking advertising demos that
        promised a product capable of generating interactive games and a virtual
        workspace.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        When the first headset finally launched, it was quickly made clear that
        the Leap's capabilities were a little more virtual than anyone
        understood. Not only did it underperform, but the $2,300 price tag boxed
        out most of the customer base. Any leap is a gamble, and this one didn't
        pay off.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Google Glass</h1>
      <br />
      <br /><img class="addimg" src="images/google-glass-1663425663.webp" alt="" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Google Glass was supposed to bring workable augmented reality to the
        world. When it was unveiled in 2012, it seemed like the obvious next
        step in portable computing. Cell phones had given us access to
        communication and the internet everywhere we went, and it only made
        sense that the next step would be to integrate those technologies more
        fully.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In fairness to Google, Glass was crafted by the company's <a href="#"> X Development
        division</a> — previously Google X — a department in charge of its moonshot
        efforts. Those are projects that are understood to be long shots, but
        have incredible potential if they work. That suggests Google knew the
        projects had slim odds of working, but you wouldn't have known it from
        the advertising.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Unlike some other devices which were bulky and unwieldy, Glass was
        relatively streamlined and unintrusive. Video demos boasted a device
        that put almost all of the functionality of your smartphone directly in
        your retina in real-time. Users were promised the ability to receive and
        respond to messages, check the calendar and weather, get travel updates
        and directions, and much more. As explained by <a href="#"> Investopedia</a>, it appears
        that Google got swept up in its own hype
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        It didn't help that Glass was ultimately released in a sort of beta, in
        hopes of gaining crucial feedback from the public to improve the
        product. Even though Google was clear it was still essentially a
        prototype, $1,500 for an unfinished device didn't sit well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Daqri</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img class="addimg" src="images/daqri-1663425663.webp" alt="" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        After a few moderate successes in the AR space, Daqri decided to pivot
        away from consumer-level products in favor of courting business
        customers. They intended to do that by developing the ultimate augmented
        reality hardware and software for factory and office workers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The company pulled in roughly $300 million in funding, according to
        Protocol, and set to work building the AR headset of the future. The
        first product announcement in 2014 promised a hard hat intended for work
        in factory settings, equipped with an AR visor. The goal was to give
        workers access to useful information, laid on top of their actual
        workspace. Retailing for $15,000, the <a href="#"> AR helmet</a> just didn't capture
        market attention in the way the company hoped.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Later, the company shifted gears to a smaller headset aimed at other
        professionals that retailed for $4,995 (via <a href="#"> The Verge</a>). It wasn't any
        more popular than the helmet. Eventually, the company shuttered, having
        never really brought its products to fruition. We may see Daqri's tech
        rise from the ashes in some other form down the line; the company's
        assets, along with some of its employees, were acquired by Snap for a
        reported $34 million (via <a href="#"> The Information</a>).
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>HoloLens</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img class="addimg" src="images/hololens-1663425663.webp" alt="" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Microsoft's HoloLens followed a similar trajectory as Google Glass,
        making big promises with impressive demonstrations that haven't yet
        manifested. When the technology was announced at a press conference in
        2015, HoloLens seemed like it would change everything about the way we
        interface with technology.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Microsoft promised a wireless head-mounted computer capable of fully
        functional augmented reality mapped onto any room. <a href="#">Demonstrations</a> 
        included robots busting through the walls of your home, and browser or
        video windows that follow you as you navigate the world. Not to mention
        convenient virtual access to your notifications, calendar, and more.
        Nearly a decade after it was announced, HoloLens still isn't available
        in any meaningful way for consumers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        While HoloLens did reach market, it was targeted toward business
        customers and cost $3,000, a price tag that is too steep for most
        consumers (via <a href="#"> Gizmodo</a>). HoloLens 2 was even more expensive, and
        <a href="#"> HoloLens 3</a> might not happen at all (via <a href="#"> Digital Trends</a>). Perhaps more
        importantly, focusing on business customers meant that developers for
        HoloLens were likewise largely constrained to business applications.
        It's unlikely the technology will really catch on until the economics of
        development and end-user purchase make more sense.
      </p>

      <h1>The Metaverse</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img class="addimg" src="images/the-metaverse-1663432807.webp" alt="" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        While AR and VR technologies focus on the experience of an individual
        user, the logical endpoint of these technologies is a shared digital
        world where all of us can work and play. In 2021, Meta (formerly
        Facebook) announced the Metaverse, an immersive and collaborative
        virtual world. If Meta is to be believed, the Metaverse will someday be
        the place humanity spends a lot of its time. We'll go to our virtual
        offices, shop in virtual stores, and hang out with our virtual friends
        at virtual pubs (via <a href="#"> Interesting Engineering</a>).
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        They probably aren't wrong in concept, but this particular launch <a href="#"> likely
        missed the mark</a>. Time will tell. Still, this latest metaverse is only
        the most recent in a long line of similar products, each with varying
        degrees of success.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Active Worlds launched in 1995, allowing users to create their own
        virtual worlds to share with others. You can think of it almost like a
        Minecraft server, where you are responsible not just for populating the
        world, but also creating it. Today, several decades later, Active Worlds
        is still operational, but boasts only about 400 users at any given time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Perhaps the most well-known metaverse, aside from Meta's, is Second
        Life, but even it is struggling. It launched in 2003 and nearly 60
        million people have signed up. As of 2018, however, active monthly users
        were around half a million, down from a million five years earlier (via
        <a href="#"> New World Notes</a>).
