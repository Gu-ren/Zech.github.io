        The massive overhaul of <a href="#">Ethereum</a> known as <a href="#">the merge</a> has finally
        happened, moving the digital machinery at the core of the second-largest
        cryptocurrency by market value to a vastly more energy-efficient system
        after years of development and delay.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        It was no small feat swapping out one way of running a blockchain, known
        as <a href="#">proof-of-work</a>, for another, called <a href="#">proof-of-stake</a>. “The metaphor that
        I use is this idea of switching out an engine from a running car,” said
        Justin Drake, a researcher at the non-profit Ethereum Foundation who
        spoke to CoinDesk before the Merge happened.
      </p>

      <h3>CoinDesk Special Coverage: <a href="#">The Ethereum Merge</a></h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The payoff is potentially gigantic. Ethereum should now consume 99.9% or
        so less energy. It's like Finland has suddenly shut off its power grid,
        according to one estimate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ethereum’s developers say the upgrade will make the network – which
        houses a <a href="#"> $60 billion</a> ecosystem of cryptocurrency exchanges, lending
        companies, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and other apps – more
        secure and scalable, too.

        When the Merge officially kicked in at 6:43 a.m. UTC, more than 41,000
        people were tuned in on YouTube to an "Ethereum Mainnet Merge Viewing
        Party." They watched with bated breath as key metrics trickled in
        suggesting that Ethereum's core systems had remained intact. After about
        15 long minutes the Merge officially finalized, meaning it could be
        declared a success. The price of ETH – whose current market value near
        $200 billion makes it the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin
        (BTC) – was largely flat after the Merge.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The update, which ends the network’s reliance on the energy-intensive
        process of cryptocurrency mining, has been closely watched by crypto
        investors, enthusiasts and skeptics for the impact it is expected to
        have on the wider blockchain industry.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Mark Cuban, investor and billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks
        basketball team, told CoinDesk he would be “watching [the Merge] with
        interest like everyone else,” pointing out that it might make ETH, the
        network's native token,<a href="#"> deflationary</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Goodbye, miners</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2008, Bitcoin introduced the world to the idea of a decentralized
        ledger – a single, immutable record of transactions that computers
        around the world could view, alter and trust without the need for
        intermediaries.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Ethereum, introduced in 2015, expanded upon the core concepts of Bitcoin
        with smart contracts – or computer programs that effectively use the
        blockchain as a global supercomputer, recording data onto its network.
        That innovation was the essential ingredient behind <a href="#"> decentralized
        finance</a> (DeFi) and <a href="#"> NFTs</a> – the main catalysts of the most recent crypto
        boom
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The Merge retires Ethereum’s proof-of-work system, where <a href="#"> crypto miners</a>
        competed to write transactions to its ledger – and earn rewards for
        doing so – by solving cryptographic puzzles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Most crypto mining today happens in “farms,” though they may be more
        aptly described as factories. Picture massive warehouses lined with rows
        of computers stacked on top of one another like shelves of books at a
        university library – each computer hot to the touch as it strains to
        pump out cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Hello, stakers</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Ethereum’s new system, proof-of-stake, does away with mining entirely.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Miners are replaced by validators – people who “stake” at least 32 ETH
        by sending them to an address on the Ethereum network where they cannot
        be bought or sold.
      </p>
      <p>
        These staked ETH tokens act like lottery tickets: The more ETH a
        validator stakes, the more likely one of its tickets will be drawn,
        granting it the ability to write a “block” of transactions to Ethereum's
        digital ledger. Ethereum introduced a proof-of-stake network in 2020
        called the Beacon Chain, but until the Merge it was just a staging area
        for validators to get set up for the switch. Ethereum’s transition to
        proof-of-stake involved merging the Beacon Chain with Ethereum’s main
        network.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        According to Beiko, the energy consumption of proof-of-stake is “not
        even a rounding error in terms of environmental impact.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        “Proof-of-stake is like running an app on your MacBook,” he said. “It's
        like running Slack. It's like running Google Chrome or running Netflix.
        Obviously, your MacBook plugs into the wall and uses electricity to run.
        But no one thinks about the environmental impact of running Slack,
        right?” Edgington pointed to the environmental impact of the Merge
        upgrade as the benefit he is personally the most excited about. “I feel
        very proud, you know, that I'll be able to look back and say I've had a
        role to play in removing a megaton of carbon from the atmosphere every
        week. That's something that meaningfully affects my family and others,”
        he said.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>New incentives</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Rather than a single piece of open-source software, the Ethereum network
        is better understood as a nation-state – a kind of living organism that
        comes together when a bunch of computers talk to one another in the same
        language, all following an identical set of rules. Ethereum’s new system
        introduces a new set of incentives for the people operating these
        computers to follow the rules as written, thereby securing the ledger
        from any unwanted tampering.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        “Proof-of-work is a mechanism by which you take physical resources and
        you convert them into security for the network. If you want your network
        to be more secure, you need more of those physical resources,” Beiko
        explained. “On proof-of-stake, what we do is we use financial resources
        to convert to security.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Although Ethereum had thousands of individual miners operating and
        securing its proof-of-work network, computers from just three <a href="#"> mining
        pools</a> dominated a majority of the network’s <a href="#"> hashrate</a>, a measure of the
        collective computing power of all miners.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        If a few of Ethereum’s big mining firms colluded to amass a majority of
        the network’s hashrate, they would have been able to execute a so-called
        <a href="#"> 51% attack</a>, making it difficult or impossible for anyone else to update
        the ledger. In proof-of-stake, the amount of ETH one stakes – not the
        amount of energy one expends – dictates control over the network.
        Proof-of-stake boosters say this makes attacks more expensive and
        self-defeating: attackers can have their staked ETH slashed, or reduced,
        as punishment for trying to harm the network.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h1>Trading the Merge</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In crypto markets, the Merge had become an object of speculation since
        at least mid-July, with traders initially viewing the event as a
        catalyst for a steep rally in the price of ETH. The market for ETH
        options started pricing in post-Merge gains, a welcome respite following
        the crash in digital-asset markets earlier in the year. The prospect of
        a fork of the Ethereum blockchain by irate crypto miners spurred a wave
        of new activity, this time as traders tried to lock in value from the
        theoretical airdrop of a new “ETHPOW” token.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In general, it is impossible to predict with certainty how the markets
        will react to a successful Merge. The upgrade has been on Ethereum’s
        roadmap since its inception, so there’s the possibility that it has
        already, by-and-large, been priced in by the market. “I think if you
        asked me maybe about three weeks ago, I would say that not only is it
        priced in, it’s overly priced in,” said Kevin Zhou of Galois Capital.
        “Now the market is roughly 70/30 in favor of this being a positive event
        for ETH.”

      <h1>What’s next?</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        "This is the first step in Ethereum's big journey towards being a very
        mature system, but there are still steps left to go," said Vitalik
        Buterin, Ethereum's co-creator, as he reflected on the Merge during
        Thursday's viewing party. He went on to mention Ethereum's relatively
        <a href="#"> high fees and slow speeds</a>, which were not addressed by the update, but
        remain as much a barrier to growing the network's user base as
        environmental concerns ever was.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Buterin, Ethereum's most visible figurehead, previously outlined a set
        of next steps for the network that includes “sharding” – a method that
        should help address the network’s sluggish transaction times and high
        fees by spreading transactions across “shards,” like adding lanes to a
        highway.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Read more: <a href="#"></a> Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?</a></h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        That upgrade was initially slated to accompany the transition to
        proof-of-stake, but it was deprioritized given the success that
        third-party solutions – called rollups – have had in solving some of the
        same issues.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Rollups foreshadow the likely future for Ethereum development, where
        community solutions – rather than updates to Ethereum’s core code – play
        the primary role in expanding the chain’s capabilities. For Buterin, the
        Merge is just the beginning. "To me, the Merge just symbolizes the
        difference between early stage Ethereum, and the Ethereum we've always
        wanted ... to become," he said on Thursday's live stream. "So let's go
        build out all of the other parts of this ecosystem and turn Ethereum
        into what we want it to be."
